# F1API
work in progress

Next Steps
- consider retrieving more data points from each position (accomplished)
- figure out when laps start/end
- store data locally (parquet file?) (SQLite - one instance per race)
- display data live
- look into live data (SignalR) https://livetiming.formula1.com/signalr
- analysing if teams have code words in the team radio messages
- fix get_lap_positions for last lap
